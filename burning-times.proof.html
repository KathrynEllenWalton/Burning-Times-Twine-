[[did somebody say magik]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="the cats" tags="" position="599,252" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/cats-gossiping.jpg"&gt; 

The cats are playing in the forest, near their home the treehouse, and as usual gossiping about other people who live in the forest. Without the cat's knowing, Wind Witch is amongst the trees. She is stealing nuts and berries from the forest animal's. 

She hears the cats talking about Noise Witch, saying she is too loud and too busy up in everyone's business all the time.

Wind Witch grabs the berries &amp; nuts, then flies back to [[the farmhouse]] and tells Noise Witch what she had overheard those cheeky cats saying.

The cats hear Nooky whistling from [[the treehouse]]. They get exicted knowing it's dinner time and race each other back home.  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="the treehouse" tags="" position="451,249" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/the-treehouse.jpg"&gt; 

The cats make so much noise coming back to the treehouse, that they wake Shu-Owl up from her nap, who sits at the top of the front door for better viewing of her surroundings. 

Nooky feeds the cats &amp; hands them all treats as they meow, meow, meow, constantly out of happiness. 

[[Shu-Owl, is an astrologer]] who notices that the [[sky is turning dark]] so she grabs her telescope and has a closer look to see what is happening up in the clouds...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="the farmhouse" tags="" position="748,252" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/farmhouse2.jpg"&gt; 

Wind Witch flies into the farmhouse to tell Noise Demon &amp; [[The Wizard]] what the cats have been saying about her. 

'How dare thoses cats speak my name!' Noise Demon yells. 

With Wind Witch yapping on what she heard, it makes the chained dogs thirsty for those cats, the Wizard simply asks //'Are you able to let go of what was a conversation that wasn't for your ears to begin with?'//

But Noise Demon, can't see past her own ego and with the help of Wind Witch, they turn the sky dark, make the rain fall and for the sun to disappear. 

Noise Demon is [[thumping and bumping]] sending vibrations back to the cats.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="sky is turning dark" tags="" position="455,403" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/sky-turning-Owl.jpg"&gt; 

Looking through her telescope, Shu-Owl can see the frequencies erupting in the clouds, causing panic to the animals in the forest, and with the vibrations in motion towards the cats and the treehouse, everyone becomes concerned knowing they need to go into battle with whatever it is causing this distrubance. 

[[it's battle time ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="thumping and bumping" tags="" position="749,402" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/thumping-bumping.jpg"&gt; 

EVERYBODY,STAND BACK!! Noise Witch is out of control!

Lightning bolts &amp; heavy HZ frequencies travel from the farmhouse up into the clouds creating a storm, that is now headed for the treehouse!
WATCH OUT CATS!

[[it's battle time ]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="The Wizard" tags="" position="900,255" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/wizard-art.jpg"&gt; 

The Wizard who is busy making his dirt art with all sorts of different dirt, looks over at Wind Witch gossiping to the Noise Demon, thinking well isn't this just the same?  

His patience begins to run out, as he has watch this scenrio time and time again, hoping for change this time around. 

[[go back -&gt;the farmhouse]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="it&#39;s battle time " tags="" position="599,400" size="100,100">   &lt;img src="images/witch-vs-noise.jpg"&gt; 
   [[Noise Demon]] VS [[Witch Doctor]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Noise Demon" tags="" position="744,520" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/noise-demon-freq.jpg"&gt; 

Noise Witch screams into her microphone and plays her guitar loud, creating [[frequencies in the clouds]]. Wind Witch dances around with the dogs barking. The sound travels across the forest, the animals hide, whilst other's eat their bag of nuts, like they are watching a movie.  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="frequencies in the clouds" tags="" position="603,800" size="100,100"> &lt;img src="images/storm.jpg"&gt; 
 
The electircal storm is out of control, with the sun struggling to shine her light to help dissolve the clouds, the storm becomes bigger waking up the lunar from their slumber. The lunar rises high above the clouds which effects the rain pour but only slighty. Which means Witch Doctor &amp; Noise Demon are ready to fight. 

[[Let's fight]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="watch the spells begin" tags="" position="448,799" size="100,100">Witch Doctor has all of the ingredients mixing in a pot, as she kneels at her alter and prays to the Goddess of protection. 

&lt;img src="images/praying-protection.jpg"&gt; 

Shu-Owl is meditating, but with one-eye open. She feels the vibrations coming closer. //'Where did Nooky get to? That girl, needs to learn to confront the conflict.'//
There is a big-bang at the door. Everyone gasps and puts up their weapons. 

One of the cats look out the window to see that it's Nooky in the rain, screaming to let her in. //'It's Nooky" the cats says. "Nooky!!' //

//'Wind Witch and the dogs are on their way!'// Nooky screams as she comes inside the treehouse. She hugs Witch Doctor and smiles at Shu-owl. The cats throw her a large bottle of perfume to spray for when Wind Witch arrives. 

[[Let's fight]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="texts a dude" tags="" position="296,602" size="100,100">Nooky is hurrying through the forest to get to the Woodlands where her dude lives. As she is hurrying she hears dogs barking in the distance. She hids behind a large old oak tree and watches the dogs being lead by Wind Witch. 

&lt;img src="images/text-a-dude-1.jpg"&gt; 

Nooky gasps, as she senses danger coming in strong. She tries to call Witch Doctor, but the powerlines seem to be broken from the storm. 

Nooky decides to turn back to follow Wind Witch &amp; the dogs that are headed towards the treehouse. [[watch the spells begin]] 

The dude is left hanging, '//Babe where are you? love Dude//'</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Witch Doctor" tags="" position="451,522" size="100,100">Nooky is a little afraid &amp; not wanting to cause any trouble, she [[texts a dude]] for a coffee and cake date whilst the cats sharpened their nails, ready for anything that comes their way. Or so they think...

&lt;img src="images/text-a-dude.jpg"&gt; 

They look up at the sky to see the [[frequencies in the clouds]]
Witch Doctor casts spells of protection and karma ten fold back to whoever is doing this. [[watch the spells begin]]  

&lt;img src="images/frequenices.jpg"&gt; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Let&#39;s fight" tags="" position="598,947" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/lets-fight.jpg"&gt; 

By now, the potection is ready to rub on Nooky and Witch Doctor then place the rest around the edges of the house. 

With the energy sucking dogs baking at the windows &amp; the cats hissing from inside, Wind Witch blows at the door which angers Shu-Owl. With her 3rd eye, [[Shu-Owl]] sends power through the door to push Wind Witch further away, giving them sometime to prepare for the next attack. 

Wind Witch fights back stronger, blowing harder onto the door, making the windows rattles, scaring off the cats as they run under the table. 

Nooky sprays her perfume under the door which gets caught up in the wind and goes into the eyes of the dogs and Wind Witch. Witch Doctor &amp; Nooky hi-5 one another. 

[[Back at the farmhouse]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Back at the farmhouse" tags="" position="746,973" size="100,100">Noise Demon is creating louder vibrations, pushing the speakers onto the ground which rattles the foundations. She is so wild at this point that no one can reach her through the sound frequencies she has created. 

&lt;img src="images/farmhouse-3.jpg"&gt;

The Wizard knows he isn't safe there as his mudhouse is starting to crumble under the intense noise. He huffs &amp; puffs and stomps &amp; claps, but his efforts go to waste. He decides to leave the farmhouse, undetected in search for his friend [[Sherk the shark]] who will be the only one who can help the Noise Demon. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="did somebody say magik" tags="" position="599,120" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/witch-house2.jpg"&gt; 

With the beauty bath spell on the boil &amp; the money oil spell ready to be bottled, Witch Doctor gets to bottling. Her friend Nooky is watching reality TV but notices it's dinner time and whistles out the window for [[the cats]] to return to eat their fresh fish grills &amp; chicken feet dinner. Yummy!!

&lt;img src="images/witches-kitchen1.jpg"&gt; </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Shu-Owl" tags="" position="447,975" size="100,100">Shu-Owl sends a telepathic message to her friend Murthy the Elephant, knowing she is in need of giudance to help the Witch Doctor and Nooky from the protection of the Noise Demon and the Wind Witch. [[Murthy the Elephant]] receives the message and lets her know telepathically to bring her &amp; her friends to him for assistance, as soon as possible. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Shu-Owl, is an astrologer" tags="" position="300,250" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/Shu-Owl.jpg"&gt; 

Shu-Owl and her owlet live with Witch Doctor &amp; their friend Nooky, who both asks alot of questions when it comes to their own spirituality and natal chart readings that is read by Shu-Owl once a month. 

Shu-Owl loves archetypal figures and finds symbolism in all that lives naturally on earth. She is a close friend to both the Witch Doctor &amp; Nooky and will do anything she can to help her friends.

[[go back -&gt;the treehouse]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Murthy the Elephant" tags="" position="449,1152" size="100,100">//'Bless you my friend.'//

//'Hello my friend, I have come to ask you to help my friends, who are in the middle of trouble. I feel both sides are projecting and protecting and no one is thinking clearly. Are you able to help us Murthy?'//

&lt;img src="images/jungle-elephant-1.jpg"&gt;

//'Of course. bring your friends to me and I will pray positive thoughts for them and for you.'//

//Thank-you, I'll send them as soon as I get back to [[the forest]].'//</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Sherk the shark" tags="" position="749,1150" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/sherk-shark1.jpg"&gt;

//'Welcome my friend'// Sherk tells The Wizard. //'I have a feeling things are not so well for some right now.'//

//'I think you'll be the only one who can get through to her, but how will i get her to come and see you?' //

//'First you need to stop Wind Witch in [[the forest]], have her return to the farmhouse and from there, you'll be able to speak to Noise Demon.'//

//'But while you're here, come look at my [[organic sea farm]]. We are creating for a new eco-system.//'</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="the forest" tags="" position="601,1202" size="100,100">The Wizard &amp; Shu-Owl return to the forest where the treehouse has been rattled by Wind Witch, who is more &amp; more out of breath with each blow. The energy-sucking dogs are thirsty &amp; tired. 

//'We need to go and [[speak to Noise Demon]] about this destruction.'// The Wizard demands and with not much hot air left to blow, Wind Witch agrees. 

Meanwhile, Witch Doctor is full of energy yet angry that anyone dare interupt her day. Shu-Owl asks Witch Doctor &amp; Nooky if they would like to meet her friend Murthy the Elephant. She explains that he is a positive thinker who embraces life from a spiritual aspect and can help heal any trauma that causes projections. 

They agree to [[visit Murthy]] the Elephant.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="organic sea farm" tags="" position="899,1152" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/ecosystem.jpg"&gt;

//'Noisy! how are you?, Come for a float and lets talk.'// Sherk says. He asks her what made her become so upset about a converstaion that was never intended for her to hear.

//'But I did hear it and now those cats are saying things about me!//' 

//'If the cats were saying great things about you then you wouldn't mind. Am I right?'//
//'I suppose.'// Noise Demon says defeated. 
//'Then the real issue here is control and your obession to have it. You need to ask yourself why?'//
//'They are so mean to me!'// Noise Witch begins to scream, scaring off the surrounding fishes. 

Sherk the Shark asks Noise Witch to sit until she can settle. [[This could take a while]]. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="visit Murthy" tags="" position="447,1347" size="100,100">&lt;img src="images/witches-murthy.jpg"&gt; 

//'Welcome my friends. I am excited that you have decided to come visit me. I will read your palms and let you know about your horoscope, then you tell me what is happening right now in your life.' //

Witch Doctor &amp; Nooky both have their horoscopes and palms read. They are told similar things such as they are powerful and are here to serve with an open heart and in exchange will recieve abundance of fourtune however they precieve that fortune. Love, money, lust, beauty, inner peace. They let Murthy know that they appericate him and will return soon for further guidance. Murthy blesses them as they leave. 

Witch Doctor &amp; Nooky both thank Shu-Owl for introuding them to Murthy the Elephant, as they all leave feeling better, headed for [[home]].</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="home" tags="" position="447,1497" size="100,100">After cleaning up the mess caused by the Noise Demon's vibrations with the help of Wind Witch. Witch Doctor, Nooky &amp; Shu-Owl all sit down together with the cute cuddly yet naughty cats to watch the latest episode of their favourite reality tv show - Keeping up with the Krows. 

//'We need our own TV show'// the cats tells the group.//'Then it will give everyone something to talk about!'// The cats laugh &amp; hiss &amp; meow as they sharpen their claws... //'hehehehe'//

There is a knock at the door. Shu-Owl opens the door and see's there is a letter on the 'witches wlecome' door mat. Shu-Owl brings the letter inside and reads it to everyone. 

//Please forgive me, I have learnt that my desire to control was really about my fear of being at the mercy of others. I am now learning to become more humbled. Noise Witch.// 

//'Sure,ok, but she isn't to come around this way again, unless she wants war.'// Witch Doctor proclaims to the group. 

The cats loves this idea, but Nooky and Shu-Owl just look at each other, knowing something will happen again, just when is the question...

The End</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="This could take a while" tags="" position="746,1499" size="100,100">Together they went through a dark, rough yet necessary transformation. Noise Demon left Sherk the Shark and thanked him for all of his spiritual guidance. 

Noise Demon heads back to the farmhouse, she reads a note the Wizard had left saying he has left for Central Europe, to be in a coven indefinitely. 

This saddens Noise Witch as she turns to sees Wind Witch in the kitchen filling up the cupboards with more stolen fruits &amp; nuts from the forest. 

//'You haven't learnt your lesson, and I don't think you ever will. You need to leave the farmhouse and not come back.'//

The Wind Witch refuses, making the Noise Demon angry. Suddenly the farmhouse is shaking as if there is an earthquake. The food from the cupboards come rolling out, as Noise Demon stands in the [[centre of the kitchen]]. 

This frightens Wind Witch and runs out of the farmhouse and into the Wind. Forever gone. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="centre of the kitchen" tags="" position="746,1649" size="100,100">Noise Witch sits alone in her farmhouse with her dogs as she writes a letter to the witches in the forest. 

Soon after she gets a knock on the door and it's her old warlock friends Hubbub and Babble with their music equiptment wanting to play music with Noise Witch. She invites them into he farmhouse and together they play music of all different frequiences.
